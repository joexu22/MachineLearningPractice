# Basic Hypothesis Driven Understanding Of Machine Learning
* Prediction of Future Stock using "Machine Learning Principles"
* Setting Up A Hypothesis -> Machine Learning
* ...Generate A Feature Table using a Mathamatical Equation... [(a)x^2 + (b)x + c]
* Stucture the data using (x,y) pairs
* Generate X so that x is from a set where x1 < x2
* Have it predict a Y given a X
* Verify the Y using the Mathamatical Equation
* I suppose a good way to internalize this is to predict forward trajectory...

* Generalize the Solution so that it solves any plot based equation based on previous momentum
