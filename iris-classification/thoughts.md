# Some Basic Understanding into the Nature of Machine Learning
* Understanding the importance of statistics
  * At the end of the day, (Machine Learning) still... at least in my mind ...
  * The design still is very human...
  * People have to design the puzzle board
    * Machine has to fill the pieces in
  * One needs to understand how much one is off by when making a metic for a problem
  * How much something can be off by

# On Solving Scam Posts Through Machine Learning Process
* Human's must first recognize the Scam
* Bring all that "data" together

  * This Human Process is put through a neural network and makes predictions based on the human's metric'd suggestions
  * At least this is my "current" personal understanding to the project on hand
